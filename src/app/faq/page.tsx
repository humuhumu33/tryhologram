        q: "What is Hologram?",
        a: "Hologram is a library that optimizes computational operations at compile-time, then executes them in constant time at runtime. It's not a runtime, service, or framework—it's code that compiles into your application binary.",
      },
      {
        q: "What problem does it solve?",
        a: "Traditional computation executes operations sequentially, so cost grows with operation count. Hologram fuses operations into fixed circuits that execute in O(1) time per element, regardless of how many operations were fused.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is it a new programming language?",
        a: "No. It's a library you use from existing languages (Rust, Python, TypeScript, Swift, Kotlin, C++).",
      },
      {
        q: "Is it a runtime like JVM or .NET?",
        a: "No. There's no separate runtime process. Hologram code compiles directly into your binary and runs in your application's process.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is it a service or daemon?",
        a: "No. There's no background service, no systemd unit, no separate process. It's just code in your application.",

    icon: Code2,
    questions: [
      {
        q: "How does Hologram achieve O(1) execution?",
        a: "At compile-time, Hologram fuses operation chains (e.g., sigmoid(relu(tanh(x))) into a single 96-byte lookup table. At runtime, each element is processed with one array lookup instead of multiple operations.",
      },
      {
        q: "What's a \"fixed circuit\"?",
        a: "A computational structure determined at compile-time, not runtime. Like a hardware circuit, but in software. The circuit topology is fixed, so execution time is predictable.",
      },
      {
        q: "What's \"canonicalization\"?",
        a: "The compile-time process that eliminates redundant operations and fuses operation chains. For example, x + 0 becomes x, and sigmoid(relu(x)) becomes a single fused lookup.",
      },
      {
        q: "What's a \"class map\"?",
        a: "A 96-byte lookup table that maps input resonance classes to output classes. Multiple operations are composed into a single class map, enabling O(1) execution.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does it work for all operations?",
        a: "Element-wise operations (add, multiply, sigmoid, relu, etc.) fuse perfectly. Operations like MatMul act as \"barriers\" that break fusion chains but still execute efficiently.",

      },
      {
        q: "Do I need to install anything on the server?",
        a: "No. Hologram compiles into your binary. For GPU backends, you need standard GPU drivers (CUDA toolkit for NVIDIA, Metal is built into macOS).",
      },
      {
        q: "Does it work in containers?",
        a: "Yes. Hologram runs inside your container, in your application process. No special container configuration needed.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does it work in VMs?",
        a: "Yes. Hologram runs inside the VM, in your application process. It doesn't know or care if it's in a VM.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need special hardware?",

      {
        q: "What are the system requirements?",
        a: "CPU: Any modern CPU (x86_64 or ARM64). SIMD optional but recommended. Memory: Sufficient RAM for your buffers (typically 100MB-1GB for models). GPU (optional): NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability 5.0+ or Metal-capable GPU. OS: Linux, macOS, Windows, or browser (WASM).",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I monitor Hologram in production?",
        a: "Monitor your application process. Hologram's CPU/memory usage appears as your application's usage. No separate monitoring needed.",
      },
      {

    questions: [
      {
        q: "How fast is it?",

      },
      {
        q: "How does it compare to traditional execution?",
        a: "For a chain of 4 operations: Traditional: 4 × 0.5µs = 2.0µs (sequential execution). Hologram: 0.2µs per element (fused, single lookup). Speedup: ~10x for typical operation chains.",
      },
      {
        q: "What's the startup overhead?",

      },
      {
        q: "What's the memory overhead?",
        a: "Small: Class maps: 96 bytes each. ISA programs: ~1 KB each. Typical overhead: 100-500 KB per application.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does performance degrade with larger inputs?",
        a: "No. Execution is O(1) per element. Processing 1M elements takes 1M × (constant time), which is linear in input size but constant per element.",
      },
      {
        q: "What about worst-case performance?",
        a: "Performance is stable because the circuit is fixed. There are no \"worst cases\"—the circuit topology determines execution time.",
      },
      {
        q: "How does it scale?",
        a: "Execution is O(1) per element. Processing 1M elements is 1M × (constant time). Scales linearly with input size, constant per element.",

        a: "Yes. Create multiple executors, one per GPU, and distribute work across them.",

        q: "What about GPU memory limits?",
        a: "Hologram buffers are allocated in GPU memory. You're limited by available GPU VRAM, same as any GPU application.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does it work on ARM processors?",

      },
      {
        q: "Can I use this for training?",
        a: "Hologram is optimized for inference. Training requires different optimizations (gradient computation, backpropagation). Hologram focuses on inference performance.",

    questions: [
      {
        q: "How does fusion work?",
        a: "At compile-time, Hologram identifies chains of element-wise operations and composes their class maps into a single lookup table. For example, sigmoid(relu(tanh(x))) becomes one 96-byte lookup instead of three separate operations.",
      },
      {
        q: "What's the \"96-class system\"?",
        a: "The mathematical foundation that enables constant-time lookups. You don't need to understand the math—just know it enables O(1) execution through fixed-size lookup tables.",
      },
      {
        q: "What's \"ISA\"?",
        a: "Instruction Set Architecture. Hologram compiles operations to backend-agnostic ISA instructions, which are then translated to native code (CPU SIMD, GPU kernels, etc.).",
      },
      {
        q: "How does cache optimization work?",
        a: "Class maps (96 bytes) fit entirely in L1 cache (32 KB). This means: L1 cache access: ~1ns, DRAM access: ~100ns. Keeping class maps in L1 means 100x faster lookups.",
      },
      {
        q: "What about operations that can't be fused?",
        a: "Operations like MatMul execute efficiently but aren't O(1) per element (they're O(n²) for matrix multiply, which is optimal). Fusion applies to element-wise operations.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if my operations aren't supported?",
        a: "Hologram supports standard operations (add, multiply, sigmoid, relu, matmul, etc.). Custom operations can be added by defining their class maps.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I see what optimizations were applied?",
        a: "Yes. Hologram provides compilation reports showing optimization passes and fusion decisions.",
