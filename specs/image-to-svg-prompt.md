I need you to completely recreate this this image to an svg without hardcoding colors, using `translate()` with a group so we have a responsive svg. We're creating this in a react component and want to control the styles in a separate css file. We're using tailwind, so feel free to use variables.

Don't make the svg padding/margin any bigger than it needs to be.

The structure should look something like this:

[componentName]/index.tsx
[componentName]/]lowercased(componentName)]Svg.tsx
[componentName]/[lowercased(componentName)].css

We're likely going to add animation to it, so make it animation friendly.
