Welcome to UOR! This guide will help you understand the core concepts and get started with the UOR Framework.

## What is UOR?

UOR (Universal Object Reference) is a framework for creating a shared language for universal data. It enables interoperability between different systems and platforms through standardized data structures and protocols.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Universal Resources

At the heart of UOR are universal resources—standardized data objects that can be referenced and shared across systems:

```javascript
{
  "id": "uor://resource/12345",
  "type": "Document",
  "content": {
    "title": "My Document",
    "body": "Document content..."
  },
  "metadata": {
    "created": "2025-11-15T00:00:00Z",
    "author": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```

### 2. Resource Types

UOR supports various resource types:

- **Documents**: Text-based content
- **Media**: Images, videos, audio
- **Collections**: Groups of related resources
- **Schemas**: Type definitions and validation rules

### 3. Addressing

Every resource has a unique UOR address that follows this pattern:

```
uor://[namespace]/[type]/[identifier]
```

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install @uor/framework
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { UOR } from '@uor/framework';

// Create a new resource
const resource = UOR.create({
  type: 'Document',
  content: {
    title: 'Hello UOR',
    body: 'This is my first UOR resource!'
  }
});

// Store the resource
await UOR.store(resource);

// Retrieve the resource
const retrieved = await UOR.get(resource.id);
```

## Next Steps
